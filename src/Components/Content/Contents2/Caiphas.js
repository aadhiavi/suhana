                Gospels: The accounts of Jesus' trial before Caiaphas are found in Matthew 26:57-68, Mark
                14:53-65, Luke 22:54-71, and John 18:12-27.

                traditional site of the Upper Room (Last Supper Room) on Mount Zion. <br />

                leading to Jesus' crucifixion.
