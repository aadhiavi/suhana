                <h2>Historical and Religious Significance</h2>

                <h3> 1. Name and Meaning:</h3>
                St. Peter: The church is dedicated to St. Peter, one of Jesus' apostles, who denied
                knowing Jesus three times before the rooster crowed (Gallicantu means "cock's crow" in
                Latin).<br />
                Location: The church is situated near the ancient site of the House of Caiaphas, the high
                priest who presided over Jesus' trial.

                <h3> 2. Biblical References:</h3>
                Peter's Denial: The church commemorates Peter's denial of Jesus, which occurred after
                Jesus' arrest and during his trial at the house of the high priest Caiaphas.
                Gospels: The denial is described in all four Gospels (Matthew 26:69-75, Mark 14:66-72,
                Luke 22:54-62, John 18:15-27).
