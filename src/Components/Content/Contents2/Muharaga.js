                southeast towards the Jezreel Valley. It rises to about 546 meters (1,791 feet) at its highest point.

                <h3> 1. Elijah and the Prophets of Baal (1 Kings 18:19-46): </h3>
                This passage describes Elijah's challenge to the prophets of Baal on Mount Carmel during the reign of
                King Ahab. Elijah challenges the prophets of Baal to prove the power of their gods by calling down fire
                to consume their sacrifices. After their failure, Elijah prays to the God of Israel, who sends fire from
                heaven to consume his sacrifice, demonstrating God's power and reaffirming His covenant with Israel. <br /><br />
