                <h3> 4. Structure: </h3> The gardens consist of 19 terraces that extend almost a kilometer up the side of Mount Carmel. At the top of the gardens is the impressive Bahai Shrine of the Bab, a golden-domed structure that houses the remains of the Bab, one of the central figures of the Bahai Faith.
                <h3> 5. Visiting: </h3> The gardens are open to the public for guided tours, which offer visitors a chance to appreciate the beauty of the gardens and learn about their spiritual significance and design.
