                Elisha's Spring, also known as Ain es-Sultan or Elisha's Fountain, is a historical and biblical site located near the ancient city of Jericho in the West Bank, rather than in Jerusalem. It is closely associated with the prophet Elisha and has significant biblical references, historical importance, and geographical features.

                <h2> Biblical References: </h2>
                Elisha's spring is prominently mentioned in the Bible in the following context:
                <h3>2 Kings 2:19-22:</h3>
                The story describes how the people of Jericho came to Elisha, complaining about the poor quality of the water. Elisha asked for a new bowl with salt, which he threw into the spring, declaring that the Lord had healed the water. From that time on, the water became pure and the land productive.

                "Then the men of the city said to Elisha, 'Please notice, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees; but the water is bad, and the ground barren.' And he said, 'Bring me a new bowl, and put salt in it.' So they brought it to him. Then he went out to the source of the water, and cast in the salt there, and said, 'thus says the Lord: "I have healed this water; from it there shall be no more death or barrenness."' So the water remains healed to this day, according to the word of Elisha which he spoke." (2 Kings 2:19-22, NKJV)

                <h2> History: </h2>
                Elisha's spring has been a vital water source for Jericho since ancient times. The spring's water was essential for the survival and prosperity of the city, making Jericho one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. The spring's association with the miracle performed by Elisha adds to its historical and religious significance.
                Jericho itself is often referred to as the "City of Palms" due to its abundant palm trees, which thrive thanks to the irrigation provided by the spring. Over the centuries, the spring has sustained agricultural activities and supported the local population.
