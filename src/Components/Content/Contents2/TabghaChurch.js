                geographical details, biblical references, and explanations:
                <h2> Geographical Details: </h2>

                <h3> 1. Location: </h3>
                Tabgha is situated on the northwestern shore of the Sea of Galilee (Lake Kinneret) in Israel. It is a
                picturesque area known for its natural beauty and historical significance in Christianity.

                <h3> 2. Significance: </h3>
                Tabgha is believed to be the location where Jesus performed several miracles, including the
                multiplication of loaves and fishes (feeding the 5,000) as recorded in the Gospels (Matthew 14:13-21,
                Mark 6:30-44, Luke 9:10-17, John 6:1-14).

                <h3> 3. Church of the Primacy of Peter: </h3>
                The Church of the Primacy of Peter is a Franciscan church built on the traditional site where Jesus
                appeared to his disciples after his resurrection and reaffirmed Peter's role as the leader of the
                apostles (John 21:15-19). It commemorates the event where Jesus asked Peter three times, "Do you love
                me?" and instructed him to "Feed my sheep."
                <h2> Biblical References: </h2>

                <h3> John 21:15-19 (ESV): </h3>
                Jesus and Peter 15 When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon, son of John, do
                you love me more than these?” He said to him, “Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.” He said to him,
                “Feed my lambs.” 16 He said to him a second time, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?” He said to him,
                “Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.” He said to him, “Tend my sheep.” 17 He said to him the third
                time, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?” Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, “Do
                you love me?” and he said to him, “Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you.” Jesus said to
                him, “Feed my sheep. 18 Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, you used to dress yourself and
                walk wherever you wanted, but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress
                you and carry you where you do not want to go.” 19 (This he said to show by what kind of death he was to
                glorify God.) And after saying this he said to him, “Follow me.”

                <h3>Explanation:</h3> This passage reflects Jesus' restoration of Peter after his denial and his
                commissioning of Peter to care for the spiritual well-being of the church (the "sheep" and "lambs"). It
                reaffirms Peter's role as a leader among the disciples.
