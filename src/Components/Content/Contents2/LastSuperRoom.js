                The Last Supper Room, also known as the Upper Room or Cenacle, is traditionally believed to be the
                site of Jesus Christ's last supper with his disciples before his crucifixion. Located in Jerusalem,
                this place holds significant religious and historical importance for Christians worldwide.
                <h2> Location </h2>
                <b> • Site: </b> The Upper Room is situated on Mount Zion in Jerusalem, near the Old City walls. <br />
                <b> • Identification: </b> The exact location of the Upper Room has been a subject of debate over the centuries.
                The current structure is a Crusader-era building constructed upon earlier Byzantine and possibly even
                first-century foundations.
                <h2> Biblical and Historical Significance </h2>
                <h3> 1. The Last Supper </h3>
                <b> Biblical Reference: </b> Matthew 26:17-30, Mark 14:12-26, Luke 22:7-38, John 13:1-17:26 <br />
                <b> Description: </b> According to the Gospels, Jesus shared a final meal with his disciples in an Upper
                Room in Jerusalem during the Passover feast. During this meal, he instituted the Eucharist (Holy
                Communion) and washed his disciples' feet, imparting important teachings and predictions. <br />
                <b> Significance: </b> The Last Supper is a central event in Christian theology, representing the
                institution of the Eucharist and Jesus' final moments of teaching before his arrest and crucifixion.
                <h3> 2. Post-Resurrection Events </h3>
                <b>Biblical Reference:</b> Acts 1:12-14 <br />
                <b> Description: </b> After Jesus' resurrection, the disciples gathered in the Upper Room for prayer and
                fellowship. It was here that they awaited the coming of the Holy Spirit, which occurred on the day of
                Pentecost. <br />
                <b> Significance: </b> The Upper Room is thus associated not only with the Last Supper but also with the
                birth of the Christian Church through the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.

                <b> Crusader Period: </b> The current structure dates to the Crusader era (12th century), built atop the
                earlier Byzantine church. It reflects Romanesque architectural style and has undergone various
                renovations over the centuries.
