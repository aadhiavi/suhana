                <b> o Reference: </b> Luke 19:41-44 <br />
                <b> o Passage: </b> "As he approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it and said, 'If you, even
                you, had only known on this day what would bring you peace—but now it is hidden from your eyes. The
                days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you and encircle you and
                hem you in on every side. They will dash you to the ground, you and the children within your walls.
                They will not leave one stone on another, because you did not recognize the time of God's coming to
                you.'" <br />
                <b> o Significance: </b> This passage recounts Jesus' lament over Jerusalem, predicting its destruction due
